# Best Practices for Confluent Skills

## Security and credentials

- **Never read `.env` files** — do not use cat, Read, head, grep, or any tool to view `.env` contents. Only reference environment variable names, never their values
- When verifying credentials are configured, check existence (`test -n "$VAR"`), not values
- Never hardcode credentials in skill instructions, test cases, or eval prompts
- Always use .env files for credential storage
- Remind users to add .env to .gitignore
- Use separate API keys for different environments
- Generated skills must include the same `.env` read prohibition in their instructions

## Error handling

- Check if resources exist before trying to create them
- Provide helpful error messages (e.g., "Topic 'orders' not found. Create it in Confluent Cloud UI first.")
- Handle Schema Registry compatibility errors gracefully
- Fail loudly with specific errors — never silently skip or produce empty output

## Documentation

- Link to official Confluent docs (docs.confluent.io), not outdated blog posts
- Include version compatibility notes (e.g., "Requires Flink 1.18+")
- Reference relevant Confluent examples from GitHub

## Testing

- Test against real Confluent environments, not mocks
- Verify actual data flow, not just API responses
- Test error cases (missing topics, schema mismatches, etc.)

## Platform-specific considerations

- **Confluent Cloud**: Topics must be pre-created; use Cloud API keys for resource management
- **Confluent Platform**: Security config varies (SASL, mTLS, Kerberos); ask user's auth method
- **Apache Kafka (OSS)**: No managed features (no Tableflow, no managed Flink); adjust scope accordingly
- **WarpStream**: Disable idempotence, increase batch sizes, large fetch sizes; see [WarpStream client config docs](https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/kafka/configure-kafka-client/tuning-for-performance.md)

## Bundled scripts

Depending on the skill's use case, include relevant scripts from this skill's `scripts/` directory:

- `check_compute_pool.py` — Flink skills
- `produce_data.py` — Producer/streaming skills (JSON_SR default)
- `consume_and_verify.py` — Consumer/verification skills
- `register_schema.py` — Schema Registry skills
- `cleanup_resources.py` — Clean up topics, schemas, Flink statements
